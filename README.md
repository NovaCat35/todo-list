## Challenges
One of the biggest struggle of this project was dealing with event listeners. Dealing with adding and removing event listeners that is constantly being called by different files that relies on other function cause a lot of frustrations as the code grew more extensive.I learn the importance with organizing everything in its own functions and module and planning ahead. This project also taught me how to organize unique elements that are created better for future projects as I watch out to avoid similar mistakes.
