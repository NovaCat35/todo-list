## Challenges
The constant addEventlisteners being called by different files that relies on other function and recreating the sameEventListeners was something that didn't catch my attention and cause a lot of frustrations with organizing everything in its own functions and module. This is the first time I had to think about the overall structure of my file instead of lumping everything in one. This project taught me how to organize better with foresight into planning and being aware of calling eventListeners functions.
