## Challenges
The constant addEventlisteners being called by different files that relies on other function and recreating the sameEventListeners was something that didn't catch my attention and cause a lot of frustrations with organizing everything in its own functions and module. This is the first time I had to think about the overall structure of my file instead of lumping everything in one. This project taught me how to organize better with foresight into planning and being aware of calling eventListeners functions.

Making custom date buttons and priority dropdowns


Set sidenav to close on project select & have better close transition, Search engine responsive

global variables and event listeners calls cause me a headache, learn to remove and separate call logic and use global variable less if possible

Learning to better manage states of element eventListener behaviors
