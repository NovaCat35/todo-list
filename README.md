## Challenges
One of the biggest struggles of this project was dealing with event listeners. Dealing with adding and removing event listeners that are constantly being called by different files that rely on other functions caused a lot of frustrations as the code grew more extensive. I learn the importance of organizing everything in its own tasks and module and planning ahead. This project also taught me how to manage unique elements that are created better for future projects as I watch out to avoid similar mistakes.
